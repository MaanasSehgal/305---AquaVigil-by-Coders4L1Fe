                        <p>
                            Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any
                            behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to
                            this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

                            This Code of Conduct is in effect in all community spaces and applies when someone is officially representing the community in public. Representation includes activities
                            like using an official email, posting from an official social media account, or acting as a designated representative at online or offline events.

                            <li>

                                warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be
                                requested.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Warning:</strong> A violation through a single incident or series of actions. Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction
                                with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding
                                interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

                                interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited
                                interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
